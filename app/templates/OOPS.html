<h1>Object Oriented Programming  </h1>
<p> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, rather than functions and logic. An object is a data field that has distinct attributes and behavior.
    OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic needed to do so. This programming approach is ideal for large, complex programs that are constantly updated or maintained. This includes manufacturing and design software, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used to create manufacturing system simulation software.</p>
<p> The structure of an object-oriented program also lends itself to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Other advantages of OOP include code reusability, scalability, and efficiency.The first step in OOP is to collect all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and identify how they relate to each other.Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being who is described by properties like name and address, to small computer programs, such as widgets.

Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. </p>
<h2> Glossary</h2>
<p> 1) Class: Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods. It allows data and methods to be grouped together.The methods of a class define the set of permitted operations on the class's data (its attributes). This close tie between data and operations means that an instance of a class - an object - is responsible for responding to messages received via its defining class's methods.
</p>
<p>2) Object: It is an instance of a particular class. In general, any number of objects may be constructed from a class definition. The class to which an object belongs defines the general characteristics of all instances of that class. Within those characteristics, an object will behave according to the current state of its attributes and environment. </p>
<p>3) Instantiation : The creation of an instance of a class - that is, an object.</p>
<p> 4) Methods: Methods are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object. Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object. Additionally, the subroutines contained in an object are called instance methods. Programmers use methods for reusability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time.</p>
<p> 5) Attributes: Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object. Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself.</p>
<p> 6) Namespace: The area of a program in which particular identifiers are visible. In a Python program, there are four types of namespaces: Built-In, Global, Enclosing, Local.</p>
<p> 7) Constructor: Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. In Python, the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.</p>
<p> 8) Fixture: In testing, a fixture provides a defined, reliable and consistent context for the tests. This could include environment or content. Fixtures define the steps and data that constitute the arrange phase of a test. In pytest, they are functions you define that serve this purpose. They can also be used to define a test’s act phase. This is a powerful technique for designing more complex tests.</p>
<p> 9) Type Hint: Some programming languages have static typing, such as C/C++. It means that you need to declare types of variables, parameters, and return values of a function upfront. The predefined types allow the compilers to check the code before compiling and running the program. Python uses dynamic typing, in which variables, parameters, and return values of a function can be any type. Also, the types of variables can change while the program runs.
    Generally, dynamic typing makes it easy to program and causes unexpected errors that you can only discover until the program runs.
    Python’s type hints provide you with optional static typing to leverage the best of both static and dynamic typing.</p>
<p> 10) Type Casting: Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users. In this article, we will see the various technique for typecasting.

There can be two types of Type Casting in Python: Implicit Type Casting and Explicit Type Casting</p>
<p> 11) Unit Test: Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of a software are tested. This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.
The unit test test framework is python’s xUnit style framework.</p>
<p> 12) Instance Method: Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state.Instance attributes are those attributes that are not shared by objects. Every object has its own copy of the instance attribute.An instance method can access and even modify the value of attributes of an instance. It has one default parameter which is self. t is a keyword which points to the current passed instance. But it need not be passed every time while calling an instance method.</p>
<p> 13) Instance Property: Instance attributes are attributes or properties attached to an instance of a class. This variable is only accessible in the scope of this object. Instance attributes are defined inside the constructor.</p>
<p> 14) Static Method: A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. A static method can’t access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.</p>
<p> 15) Encapsulation: Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.
    A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.</p>
<p> 16) Inheritance: Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. . For example, an application may define a “business object base” class that all business objects inherit from. This base class can contain members common to all child classes, such as entity state information. The benefits of inheritance are:
    It represents real-world relationships well.It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.</p>
<p> 17) Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name being used for different types.. For example, the Validate method in Customer class performs differently from the Validate method in the Order class.</p>
<p> 18) Abstraction: An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation. While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class.</p>
