<h2> Continous Integration and Deployment</h2>

<p> This project was setup priorly to use GitHub actions. Docker, PyCharm were installed and configured before hand. To review code using development server, Heroku is used. First we have to
connect our pipeline to the corresponding GitHub repository. We may also need to also configure an app.json </p>
<p> The CD in CI/CD refers to continuous delivery and/or continuous deployment, which are related concepts that sometimes get used interchangeably. Both are about automating further stages of the pipeline, but they’re sometimes used separately to illustrate just how much automation is happening.
    A major prerequisite to CI/CD is Continuous Integration (CI). CI is an automated process for continually integrating software development changes. CI processes automate the building, testing, and validation of source code. By working with CI capabilities, developers can accelerate their code release cycles, making it less likely to run into long feature development cycles and the challenges that come with it, such as merge conflicts.

Continuous delivery usually means a developer’s changes to an application are automatically bug tested and uploaded to a repository (like GitHub or a container registry), where they can then be deployed to a live production environment by the operations team. It’s an answer to the problem of poor visibility and communication between dev and business teams. To that end, the purpose of continuous delivery is to ensure that it takes minimal effort to deploy new code.

Continuous deployment can refer to automatically releasing a developer’s changes from the repository to production, where it is usable by customers. It addresses the problem of overloading operations teams with manual processes that slow down app delivery. It builds on the benefits of continuous delivery by automating the next stage in the pipeline.</p>
